# BuddySystem
A simple app to randomly create pairs of 2 or maximum 3 members from a team

## Motivation
As most of the people are Working-From-Home these days, social interactions have become very limited. This app can create pairs of team members random, like in real life, to connect for couple of minutes of conversation, maybe over coffee.

## How to use
Step 1. Update ./data/members.json file with team members information
Step 2.
```
python3 ./src/app.py <json-file-path>
```

## Requisite
```
pip install random_dice_roller
```
